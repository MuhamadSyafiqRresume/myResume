Aivosto Visustin v8


This is an agreement between you, the end user, and Aivosto Oy, a
Finland company. By installing, copying, distributing or using this
software, you agree to be bound by the terms of this license agreement.

This agreement applies to the computer software Visustin, major version
number 8, including all available editions and documentation,
hereinafter referred to as the Software.

IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, DO NOT INSTALL,
COPY, DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS SOFTWARE.


1. GRANT OF LICENSE. Aivosto Oy grants to you a nonexclusive license to
install, copy, distribute and use the Software, in machine-readable
binary executable code form, according to the terms set forth below.


2. VERSIONS. The Software is provided under a "Try before you buy"
concept. A Demo Version is a copy of the Software with a limited use
period and/or a limited set of features. The Demo Version is labeled
with the word "Demo" and is provided for the purpose of evaluation. A
Full Version is a copy of the Software where some or all Demo Version
limits on the use period and/or set of features have been lifted.


3. USE OF THE DEMO VERSION. Subject to these terms, you are hereby
licensed to use the Demo Version for evaluation purposes without charge
for a period of 90 days.


4. DISTRIBUTION OF THE DEMO VERSION. You may copy and distribute the
Demo Version of the Software to anyone via any means provided that:
a) you copy and distribute the complete, unmodified Demo Version as
   available from Aivosto Oy, AND
b) you don't copy or distribute any instructions or methods to
   turn the Demo Version to a Full Version, AND
c) you don't charge anything for the Demo Version, other than a
   reasonable cost for the storage media it is on, AND
d) you agree to stop further distribution of the Demo Version when
   three (3) years have passed since the Demo Version was made
   available by Aivosto Oy, AND
e) you agree to stop further distribution of the Demo Version if
   requested by Aivosto Oy.


5. USE OF THE FULL VERSION. Use of the Software for any other purposes
than what is described above under the headings "Use of the Demo
Version" and "Distribution of the Demo Version" requires the purchase of
a Full Version license.

You may not copy or distribute the Full Version. A Full Version license
entitles you to make a reasonable number of copies for your own licensed
use.

An Installation is defined as an installed and activated Full Version of
the Software. Each computer hardware and operating system user account
combination requires a separate Installation.

The license type defines the number of Installations and users allowed.
Additional Installations are permitted only if the Software is first
uninstalled so that the number of Installations allowed by the license
type is not exceeded at any time. Unless otherwise indicated, your
license is a single user license.

A SINGLE USER LICENSE permits two (2) Installations of the Software:
- a primary Installation for one (1) simultaneous user, and
- a secondary Installation for the exclusive use of the primary user
  of the primary Installation.

A TEAM LICENSE is equivalent to five (5) single user licenses.

AN N-PACK, where N is a number, is equivalent to N single user licenses.

A SITE LICENSE allows one hundred (100) Installations. The site license
covers any number of users in a single organization within a radius of 3
miles (5 km). This area is referred to as the Site. In addition,
employees of the organization are allowed to use the Software outside
the Site on their portable and home computers in either of the following
cases: the employee either works solely at home, or the employee works
at the Site a minimum of one day/week. Independent contractors of the
organization may use the Software at the Site but not at other
locations.

AN UNLIMITED SITE LICENSE is equivalent to a site license that allows an
unlimited number of Installations.

A WORLD-WIDE LICENSE is equivalent to a site license that covers any
location where the organization operates. The size of the license
determines the allowed number of Installations.

AN EDUCATIONAL LICENSE has the following additional restrictions:
a) The Software may not be used for any revenue-generating activity.
b) The license may not be transferred.


6. ACTIVATION. Installation and use of the Software may require
technical activation using an Internet connection. If the computer
hardware, system environment or operating system user account
information is changed, or the Installation has been damaged, a new
activation may be required. Aivosto Oy may limit the number of
activations in a given time period. Before activation, Aivosto Oy may
require proof of purchase of a valid license and proof of uninstallation
of an existing Installation.

Activation may be permanent or temporary. A temporary activation is
valid for a limited time period; continued use of the Software may
require a new activation after the period.

The availability of activation is guaranteed for three (3) years after
purchase. During this time, activation is free of charge. After this
time, activation may not be available or may require additional payment
at the decision of Aivosto Oy.


7. UPGRADES. To obtain this license as a product upgrade or conversion,
you must first have a license for the software that is eligible for the
upgrade or conversion (Previous License). Upon upgrade or conversion,
this agreement takes the place of the license agreement of the Previous
License, and the Previous License terminates.

Unless otherwise indicated, a valid license to use the Full Version
includes the right to install free version updates, provided that the
major version number has not changed. Before giving a free update,
Aivosto Oy may require proof of purchase of a valid license. Aivosto Oy
reserves the right to assign version numbers.


8. TRANSFERS. You may transfer a license to the Software to someone else
by written consent of Aivosto Oy. Such consent is not to be unreasonably
withheld provided that you conform to the following requirements:
a) you delete all Installations and copies of the Full Version, AND
b) you inform Aivosto Oy of the transfer 30 days in advance, AND
c) you don't transfer, assign, rent, lease, sell or otherwise dispose of
   the Software on a temporary basis, AND
d) you transfer your entire license.


9. COPYRIGHT. The Software is protected by copyright laws and
international treaty provisions. You acknowledge that no title to the
intellectual property in the Software is transferred to you.


10. REVERSE ENGINEERING AND CRACKING. You agree that you will not
attempt to reverse compile, modify, adapt, translate, copy, emulate,
clone, or disassemble the Software in whole or in part. You also agree
that you will not attempt to circumvent ("crack") any technical
limitations on the period of use or available set of features of the
Software, unless permitted by a valid license. Any version of the
Software that is not digitally signed by Aivosto Oy, Finland, is
considered a Modified Version. You may not install, copy, distribute or

11. PROHIBITED USES. The Software may not be used for the design,
development, production, use or stockpiling of weapons. The Software may
not be used to provide automated services to anyone who is not licensed

AIVOSTO OY SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF BUSINESS PROFITS,
BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF BUSINESS INFORMATION, AND THE LIKE)
ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE SOFTWARE EVEN IF AIVOSTO
OY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. ANY LIABILITY OF
AIVOSTO OY WILL BE LIMITED EXCLUSIVELY TO PRODUCT REPLACEMENT OR REFUND
OF PURCHASE PRICE.


13. TERMINATION. This license is effective until terminated. If
indicated as a time-limited license, this license will immediately
terminate without notice from Aivosto Oy when the license period
expires. This license will immediately terminate without notice from
Aivosto Oy if you fail to comply with any provision of this license.
Upon termination you shall destroy all the copies and Installations of
the Software, including modified copies, if any.


14. GOVERNING LAW AND DISPUTES. This agreement shall be governed by the
laws of Finland and shall benefit Aivosto Oy, its successors and
assigns. Any disputes shall be settled primarily through negotiations.
In the event that disputes cannot be settled through negotiations, they
shall be settled by the Finnish courts at the domicile of Aivosto Oy.


15. SEVERABILITY. In the event of invalidity of any provision of this
license, such invalidity shall not affect the validity of the remaining
portions of this license.


16. RESERVED RIGHTS. Aivosto Oy reserves the right to change the license
terms at any time, in which case the new terms will apply to copies of
